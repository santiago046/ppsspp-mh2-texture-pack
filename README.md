# PPSSPP - Manhunt 2 Texture Pack

This is a PPSSPP texture pack for the Manhunt 2 PSP version, which enhances the original textures by doubling their resolution and reducing dithering. The textures are ported from the PS2 and PC versions of the game.

## How to Install

**Before installing, make sure that:**
- Your PPSSPP version is 1.15.0 or higher
- You have run the game at least once

**To install the texture pack:**
1. Download the ZIP file from the [latest release](https://github.com/santiago046/ppsspp-mh2-texture-pack/releases/latest)
2. Open the ZIP file in PPSSPP as if it were a game
3. Wait until the installation process is completed

**For advanced users:**  
You can use some alternative textures by editing the `textures.ini` file. You will find a section about it in the file.
