## Manhunt 2 PS2 Textures for PSP
This is a PPSSPP texture pack for Manhunt 2. It replaces the original PSP textures with the PS2 ones.

You can see some examples [here](https://imgsli.com/MTEzNTg3). The main difference is that most textures have twice the resolution of the original ones.

A special thanks to [Sor3nt](https://github.com/Sor3nt) for creating [Manhunt Toolkit](https://github.com/Sor3nt/manhunt-toolkit), tool that saved me a lot of time and work alongside with [FDUPES](https://github.com/adrianlopezroche/fdupes) by Adrian Lopez.

## How to Install
If you are using the USA version, make sure you have opened the game at least once before installing the texture pack.

Download the latest ZIP file from [Releases](https://github.com/santiago046/manhunt2-ppsspp-texture-pack/releases) and open it directly with PPSSPP.

The release 2.0.0 is only compatible with PPSSPP 1.15 or higher, because the textures are saved in BASIS UASTC format now.
